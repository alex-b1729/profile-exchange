# ProfileExchange

A digital profile manager and CRM that allows you to share different content about yourself with different groups. 
This includes resume/cv for a job search, personal contact info with family and friends, research portfolios, etc. 

You can build your social network by connecting a chosen profile with other users. 
Or share your profile with anyone through private shared links. 
Shared links include privacy features such as expiration dates or expiring after a limited number of views. 

Clean, responsive design made with Bootstrap. 
Looks and works great on desktop and mobile.
